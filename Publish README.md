# Sonic Heroes Archipelago Client

## What is Archipelago?

Archipelago is an open source project aimed at creating a network of game randomizers which can randomize items between games. You might need something to progress but it's in someone elses game and vice versa.

## How does Sonic Heroes work with AP?

The entire game is handled through the level select (challenge) menu and separates the game into gates. Each gate has a random boss that can be unlocked by collecting a specified number of emblems and that must be beaten to unlock the next gate. Emblems among many other items can be collected by completing stages, killing enemies with Team Dark, collecting rings with Team Rose, and completing objectives with Team Chaotix. 

The final gate will always have Metal Madness as a boss. Your game ends on beating Metal Overlord.

## How do I start?

You'll need this mod along with Archipelago. Head over to the Archipelago.gg project for more information.
